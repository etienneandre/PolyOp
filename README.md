# PolyOp

## Operations on polyhedra

###### v 1.1

Operations on non-necessarily closed, non-necessarily convex polyhedra: (relatively) simple layer on the [Parma Polyhedra Library](http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/) (PPL), with some hopefully useful additions.
All operations use the `Pointset_Powerset NNC_Polyhedron` data structure from PPL


Some of the operations allowed by PolyOp:
- intersection
- union
- difference
- negation
- satisfiability
- time elapsing
- time backward-elapsing ("past")
- variable elimination (by existential quantification)
- Boolean tests (inclusion, equalityâ€¦)
- exhibition of a concrete point in the polyhedron
- computation of the predecessors of a subset of a zone within a source zone (given the set of variables subject to time-elapsing (typically clocks), and the set of variables reset between the two zones); this function is typically useful to reason about parametric zones in parametric timed automata or parametric time Petri nets

From version 1.0, several operations can be performed sequentially using the same call to PolyOp

Basic call syntax:

```
polyop examples/example.polyop
```

See examples of the input syntax in `examples/example.polyop`.

(Some more examples in `tests/testcases/`)
